as a devops engineer we need to deploy code from git hub to testing environment
     downloand
      build
      mvn install
      /target/jar war files need to up into linux server

then we need to say to testing team that we did build.

mvn archetype:generate > fs.output
access token
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

how to clone private repo

by using access token we can use private repo to servers

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
export M2_HOME=/opt/software_packages/apache-maven-3.8.6
export MAVEN_HOME=/opt/software_packages/apache-maven-3.8.6
export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

export JAVA_HOME=/opt/software_packages/jdk-18.0.2.1

export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH


have you devolped pom file : No
pom: project object model.

2) linux server have local repo what is that path:ls -al
3)maven goals

 validate: check if all information necessary for the build is available
compile: compile the source code
test-compile: compile the test source code
test: run unit tests
package: package compiled source code into the distributable format (jar, war, â€¦)
integration-test: process and deploy the package if needed to run integration tests
install: install the package to a local repository
deploy: copy the package to the remote repository

while developer develop code in local code sucessfully complied
but when he is push to linux error he getting error. why?

port number for ssh 22 we cant change this port number
windows   3389
mysql   3306 cant change
